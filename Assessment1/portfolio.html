      <h3>A front-end enthusiast.</h3>
      <p>
        Based in Nigeria, I am a front-end developer with 6months of
        experience.<br />
        I am very passionate about building valuable and accessible web apps<br />
        that users love. Before making the switch to development I have
        worked<br />
        as a freelance graphics designer. This experience has really proven<br />
        valuable to me in my development process as the design principles I<br />
        learnt were transferable to my newly found passion. I have worked on
        a<br />
        number of exciting learning and personal projects which have
        stretched<br />
        my abilities and sharpened my skillset. I am more than glad work on a<br />
        project with you.
